## Prerequisites: Userscript Manager

Userscripts require a browser extension to run. You must install one of the following before proceeding:

-   **Tampermonkey** (Recommended for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
    
-   **Violentmonkey** (For Chrome, Firefox, Edge)
    
-   **Greasemonkey** (For Firefox)
    

## Step 1: Navigate to the Script Page

1.  Click the link below, or copy and paste the URL into your browser's address bar to visit the script's official Greasy Fork page: [Imgur Proxy Userscript on Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/551401-imgur-proxy "null")
    

## Step 2: Click the Install Button

On the Greasy Fork page, you will find the main installation trigger.

1.  Locate the large, green **"Install"** button on the right-hand side of the page.
    
2.  Click this button. Greasy Fork will then redirect you to the raw script code, which your userscript manager will automatically detect and intercept.
    

## Step 3: Confirm Installation in the Manager

Your userscript manager (e.g., Tampermonkey) will open a new tab or window showing the script code and asking for final confirmation.

1.  Review the script details, including its name and the websites it is intended to run on (`@match` rules).
    
2.  Click the final, prominent **"Install"** button within the manager's confirmation screen to add the script to your active scripts list.
    

## Step 4: Verification

The script is now enabled and running!

1.  Navigate to a website where the Imgur Proxy script is designed to run (i.e., any page that embeds or links to Imgur content).
    
2.  Check the userscript manager icon in your browser's toolbar. It should indicate that the script is currently active on the page you are viewing.
    

If you ever need to temporarily disable or permanently remove the script, you can do so through the **Dashboard** or **Manage Scripts** option found in your userscript manager's toolbar menu.
